# Data Structures & Algorithms

This project's sole aim is to combine certain problems along with the knowledge needed to solve them & solutions, so as to create a single stop, for people starting out with DS/Algo.

Currently, solutions to problems listed [here](https://www.codechef.com/certification/data-structures-and-algorithms/prepare) are provided. (this is an ongoing activity, as of 16.04.2020 :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
